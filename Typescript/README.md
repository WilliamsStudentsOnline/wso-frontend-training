# Typescript

We will be building on the previous project and converting it into [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain Javascript. This is beneficial for our projects because it allows our compiler and code editor to perform static checking and ensure that we are passing the correct parameters in our code. 


A tutorial can be found [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html).
