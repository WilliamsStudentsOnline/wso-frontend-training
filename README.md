# WSO Frontend Training

This repository contains projects of different levels to onboard you and get you comfortable with HTML/CSS/Javascript/React. Note that this training will not fully teach you everything possible about the various technologies, but rather seeks to build familiarity with them, as well as the confidence to engage in similar projects in the future.

The success of this training greatly depends on the amount of effort you put in, as well as continued communication with your front-end lead. Reach out to us any time :)
