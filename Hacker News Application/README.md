# Hacker News Application

In this project, we will be following Robin Wieruch's [React-Redux tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-redux-tutorial#the-react-redux-project). Simply create a repository, share it with your team lead, follow along the tutorial, and communicate with your front-end lead when you have reached each one of these checkpoints:

- Redux: Re-render React
- Redux and Data Fetching
- Tests in Redux

There is a [Javascript crash course](js-crash-course.md) in this folder that goes through basic Javascript syntax for your reference, as well as a short [document](redux.md) motivating the use of [Redux](https://redux.js.org), which is the primary focus of this project.

Suggested Time: 2 weeks

## Pre-requisites

- Should have done the Personal Website (React) project
