## Requirements:

1. Must be responsive to mobile (e.g. Resizing the browser window up to a minimum width of 480px should still allow for all content to be seen)
1. Must include at least one CSS:hover ability
1. Must include at least one CSS animation

Note that requirements 2 and 3 are meant for your front-end lead to see that you can use various CSS features, and can be removed afterwards should you not want them in your final product.

## Setting Up:

**Initializing the repository and files**

1. Create a new GitHub repository `<repo-name>`. Initialize the repository.
2. Share the repository with your front-end team lead.
3. Open to your local development folder and run the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<gh-username>/<repo-name>
$ cd <repo-name>
$ touch index.html styles.css sample.html sample-styles.css
```

4. Open the provided files in this Github folder, and copy their contents to the files you have in your local repository. These are starter files with examples to help you work with HTML/CSS.

**Development!**

At this point, you should be all set to develop!

5. Develop your website, while ensuring to commit your changes along the way. Past submissions from other students can be found [below](#Past-submissions).
6. You might feel completely lost, and that is fine - start simple.
   - Sketch out what you want to do to see how things are organized.
   - Get inspiration from how other websites organize their information via [inspect element](../Basic%20Tools/Developer%20Tools.md)
   - Mess with the starter code provided in `sample.html` and `sample-styles.css`
   - Look out some online tutorials - a good place to start might be at [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/)
   - Ask your front-end lead!
   - You can open HTML files in your browser simply by double-clicking them. For greater convenience, you can also keep them open in your browser and refresh to see the latest changes applied!

## Helpful Tips:

- Ensure Responsive Design:
  - Remember to avoid using absolute numbers for most widths/heights where possible.
  - Look into CSS grid/ flexbox for help with responsive design.
  - Consider using em/rem for font sizes, although they may not be necessary most of the time.
- Know how to use your Developer Tools!

## Past Submissions:

Found below are submissions from students who have previously completed this project, and consented to sharing their repository here.
