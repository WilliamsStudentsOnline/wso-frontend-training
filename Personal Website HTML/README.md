## Requirements: 

1. Must be responsive to mobile (e.g. Resizing the browser window up to a minimum width of 480px should still allow for all content to be seen)

## Setting Up:

**Initializing the repository and files**
1. Create a new GitHub repository `<repo-name>`. Initialize the repository.
2. Share the repository with your front-end team lead.
3. Open to your local development folder and run the following commands:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<gh-username>/<repo-name>
$ cd <repo-name>
```
4. Separately, download the starter files at`personal-website-html.zip` and extract them to the folder you just created. These files contain some html/css code, and should be a good starting point for development.

**Development!**

At this point, you should be all set to develop!

5. Develop your website, while ensuring to commit your changes along the way

## Helpful Tips:
* Ensure Responsive Design:
    * Remember to avoid using absolute numbers for most widths/heights where possible.
    * Look into CSS grid/ flexbox for help with responsive design.
    * Consider using em/rem for font sizes, although they may not be necessary most of the time.
* Know how to use your Developer Tools!
