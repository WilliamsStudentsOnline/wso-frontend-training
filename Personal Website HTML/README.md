## Requirements: 

1. Must be responsive to mobile (e.g. Resizing the browser window up to a minimum width of 480px should still allow for all content to be seen)

## Setting Up:

**Initializing the repository and files**
1. Create a new GitHub repository `<repo-name>`. Initialize the repository.
2. Share the repository with your front-end team lead.
3. Open to your local development folder and run the following commands:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<gh-username>/<repo-name>
$ cd <repo-name>
$ touch index.html styles.css sample.html sample-styles.css
```
4. Open the provided files in this Github folder, and copy their contents to the files you have in your local repository. These are starter files with examples to help you work with HTML/CSS.

**Development!**

At this point, you should be all set to develop!

5. Develop your website, while ensuring to commit your changes along the way

## Helpful Tips:
* Ensure Responsive Design:
    * Remember to avoid using absolute numbers for most widths/heights where possible.
    * Look into CSS grid/ flexbox for help with responsive design.
    * Consider using em/rem for font sizes, although they may not be necessary most of the time.
* Know how to use your Developer Tools!
